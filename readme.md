Horizon is a responsive picture frame that recreates the sky from any location on Earth, blending color and sound into a telepresence experience. It does so by retrieving real-time location data through an API and translating it into dynamic Neopixel sky gradients, projected through an acrylic overlay. Complemented by immersive ambient soundscapes generated with Eleven Labs, the frame uses an Arduino Nano 33 BLE and onboard speaker to render the visual and auditory essence of faraway skiesâ€”inviting users into the quiet act of watching the horizon, anywhere they wish to be.
